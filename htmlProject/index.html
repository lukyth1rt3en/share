    <p>My name is Anthony Madeya-Chabi but my friends call me Tony. I live in Algonquin, Illinois. I enjoy reading, gaming, and programming.</p>
    <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>I graduated from Harper College with an Associates in Arts. I attended and Graduated Coder Camps in 2016 from the Chicago Campus and am currently enrolled for a refresher.</p>
    <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
    <p>My interest in programming started when I took a Java class at Harper while trying to decide my major and enjoyed it a lot, but i didn't really become interested until my older brother attended Coder
    Camps himself. We would talk almost everyday and his enthusiasm and passion for coding rubbed off on me. </p>
